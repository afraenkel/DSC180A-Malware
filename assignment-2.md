Assignment #2: Cleaning and EDA (Due Feb 14, 11:59 PM)
===============================

In this assignment you will:

1.  Statistically assess the quality of the data, justify the
    data-cleaning logic, and explain/analyze the
    features/statistics/target needed for the replication (report).
    
2.  Develop and justify data cleaning and feature extraction (code).

### Part 1

* This assignment will build off of the data ingestion pipeline from
  assignment #1, which created smali code on disk. The following tasks
  begin with this smali code to create analyzable data.
  
* (Graph definitions). Define and explain the graphs being used to
  model the android applications (from the Hindroid paper). Explain
  any computationally relevant portions of the process of writing
  (text processing) code to extract the nodes and edges of the
  graphs.
  
* (EDA on Apps). Statistically describe the set of applications you
  have collected. This is will require defining your own relevant
  statistics (e.g. number of classes/app, most common library used,
  graph-degree related statistics) to investigate and understand the
  population of apps that you've downloaded. In particular, you should
  look at how these statistics differ across two relevant classes of
  apps (this may be one-app-type vs another-app-type; malware vs
  benign).
  
* (Baseline Classification Model). Using the handcrafted
  features/statistics from above, train and evaluate a baseline
  classification model that differentiate between two relevant classes
  of apps. Try a variety of classifiers (logistic regression, random
  forest, gradient boosted trees), but don't spend too much time
  tuning the parameters. Also justify your choice of metric! (This
  model will serve as the basis of comparison for the Hindroid model).

  
### Part 2

Develop code to clean data (as defined and justified in Part 1),
create the features for the replication, compute the statistics
for the report, and train the baseline model. Such code should conform
to the methodology portion of the course (e.g. using the project template).

In particular, your project should have a `run.py` with the following
targets:
1. `data` creates the data needed for analysis.
2. `process` cleans and prepares the data for analysis (e.g. cleaning
   and feature creation).
3. `data-test` ingests a small amount of *test data* (that `process`
   can then process).

(A train target will be added for assignment 3).

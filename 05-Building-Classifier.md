## Reading: Support Vector Machines (SVM)

### Introduction

SVM are supervised machine learning algorithms that are used for classification (and regression). As you already know, this is the classification algorithm Hindroid uses to classify an App as malware or benign. For this assignment, you only need a very basic understanding of SVMs and you will be able to build your classifier. We are going to cover them in detail in the next section after you have already used them and are familiar with them.

Please go through [this](https://monkeylearn.com/blog/introduction-to-support-vector-machines-svm/) 
tutorial. It is a succinct 5-min read that should help your revise SVM. 
Assume red-triangles are malwares and blue-circles are benign apps.

### Building the classifier

* **Raw Data**: Now you have access to malware's decompiled code. Use the code written in the previous assignment to build the $A$ matrix for both the malware and benign apps. Remember $A$ matrix is the matrix connecting Apps and APIs. Additionally, compute $M$<sub>$p$</sub> = $A$$A^T$.
* **Training Data**: Create training and testing dataset <$X_{train}, y_{train}$> and <$X_{test}, y_{test}$>, where $X$ is an App and $y$ is the label (malware/benign).
* **Classifier**: Build an SVM classifier. SVMs only need the dot-product of the data-points for classification, in our case, this will be the commuting matrix $M$<sub>$p$</sub>[$i$][$j$], where $i$ and $j$ are the indexes corresponding to the Apps.

<!-- In other words, for two apps, $x$<sub>$1$</sub> and $x$<sub>$2$</sub> indexed by $i$ and $j$ respectively, the value of $K$($x$<sub>$1$</sub>, $x$<sub>$2$</sub>) is $M$<sub>$p$</sub>[$i$][$j$], where $K$($x$<sub>$1$</sub>, $x$<sub>$2$</sub>) is the dot-product corresponding to apps $x$<sub>$1$</sub> and $x$<sub>$2$</sub>. -->

### Implementation

You can use scikit's [SVM](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/svm.html)
for your assignment. As explained above you are going to assume that you already have the 
pre-computed kernel matrix in the form of $M$<sub>$p$</sub>. Hence, you will need to use 
[custom kernels](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/svm.html#custom-kernels).
More specifically, you can directly use [Gram-Matrix](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/svm.html#using-the-gram-matrix).

### Extra
If you just can't wait till the next section to learn the theory behind SVMs, [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PwhiWxHK8o) is really a great lecture and these are some great [slides](http://web.mit.edu/6.034/wwwbob/svm-notes-long-08.pdf). Have fun!

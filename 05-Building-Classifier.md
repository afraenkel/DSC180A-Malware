## Reading: Support Vector Machines (SVM)

This is a refresher on SVM as it is used in Hindroid for classification. 
I am hoping you already know how SVM works and this is to help you brush-up your concepts.

Please go through [this](https://monkeylearn.com/blog/introduction-to-support-vector-machines-svm/) 
tutorial. It is a succinct 5-min read that should help your revise SVM. 
Assume red-triangles are malwares and blue-circles are benign apps.

Now, as we know SVMs only need the dot-product of the data-points for 
classification, in our case this will be the commuting matrix M<sub>p</sub>[i][j].

So, for two apps, x<sub>1</sub> and x<sub>2</sub> indexed by ``i`` and ``j`` respectively, the value of K(x<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>2</sub>)
is M<sub>p</sub>[i][j]

In the next discussion, we will discuss SVMs in more detail. But for this assignment, 
this much understanding should be enough. Once you have already used SVMs, you will 
appreciate the under-the-hood theory.

## Implementation

Now, you can use scikit's [svm](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/svm.html)
for your assignment. As explained above you are going to assume that you already have the 
pre-computed kernel matrix in the form of M_p. Hence, you will need to use 
[custom kernels](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/svm.html#custom-kernels).
More specifically, you can directly use [Gram-Matrix](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/svm.html#using-the-gram-matrix).

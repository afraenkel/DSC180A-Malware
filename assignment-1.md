Assignment #1: The Data (Due Date: Jan 24th, 11:59 PM)
=======================

In this assignment, you will:

1.  Write a survey of the data and the context in which it was created (report).

2.  Describe and justify the data ingestion process in part 3 (report).

3.  Develop code for ingesting and storing the data for later use
    (code).
    
The report portion of the assignment should be written in markdown,
saved as a pdf, and uploaded to Gradescope.

The data ingestion code should be submitted to Gradescope as a
programming assignment.

### Part 1

Introduce the problem being investigated and describe the data being
used to approach the problem. That is, describe the Malware Android
Application classification problem, referring to the
[Hindroid](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~yqsong/papers/2017-KDD-HINDROID.pdf)
paper for specifics and assigned articles for context.

The data you will use in the replication consist of:
1. Benign Android Application from apkpure.com that *you* will collect
   and decompile to Smali Code.
2. Malware samples provided to you as Smali Code.

Address the appropriateness of the data design and collection:

-   Why is the data is appropriate to address the problem? 

-   What are the potential shortcomings of the data for addressing the problem? 

-   What data have been used to address this problem in the past? (Historical context)

Summarize relevant details of the data generating process, describing
the population that the data represents, whether that population is
relevant to the question at hand, while addressing possible questions
of data reliability.

The material in this section should be informed by the listed
background readings and the introduction/data explanation sections of
the Hindroid Paper.

### Part 2

Describe the data ingestion process. This description should:

-   Specify from where the data originates, addressing legal issues
    pertaining to access.

-   Address any data privacy concerns and how your data pipeline
    handles them.

-   Lay out the schema and justify the decisions (what's the unit
    corresponding to an observation? What are the storage
    considerations?)

-   Address the applicability of the pipeline to similar data sources
    you might anticipate using (what might those be?).

### Part 3

In a private GitHub repository for your project, structured according
to the methodology portion of the course, create a data ingestion
pipeline for the result-replication project. The pipeline should:

-   Write code that creates a list of Android Apps on apkpure that
    will make up the begign apps in your training set. The
    `sitemap.xml` should help with this. (Be sure to address this set
    in part 2!).
    
-   Given an android app on apkpure, download the apk, decompile the
    apk to Smali code.
    
-   Given a directory contain Smali code (as returned from running
    `apktool`), organize it on disk (justify your
    processing in part 2). The data source should be specified as
    configuration.

-   Store the data according to your designed schema, taking care to
    appropriately type the data and implement the best storage design.

-   The stored data should be in a form most appropriate for
    assessment and cleaning (EDA).

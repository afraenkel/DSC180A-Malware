# Adversarial ML

## Topics Covered

* Introduction to Adversarial Machine Learning
* Attacking Malware Detection

## References and Reading

The following resources were summarized and discussed in section:

* The paper [Android HIV: A Study of Repackaging Malware for Evading
  Machine-Learning Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.04218.pdf)
  approaches the problem of tweaking Android APKs to evading detection
  by two recent ML-powered Malware detection algorithms.
  
* The paper [MAMADROID: Detecting Android Malware by Building Markov
  Chains of Behavioral Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.04433.pdf)
  designs a Malware detection algorithm based on sequences of API
  calls. Besides being the target of the Android HIV paper, this paper
  is a good example of experimental design in Malware detection to
  follow in your project proposals.
  
* A thorough set of references and definitions for the subject of
  adversarial machine learning can be found in [A Taxonomy and
  Terminology of Adversarial Machine
  Learning](https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8269-draft).
  
## Participation

Participation this week will be checked through the required
appointment with either the professor or TA about the project
proposal.

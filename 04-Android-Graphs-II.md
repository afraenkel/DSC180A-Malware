# Graphs from Android Code (Part II)

### Topics

* Creating graphs from Smali code.
* Differentiating app types from graph statistics.

## Readings, Tasks, and Analyses

* Read the [HinDroid](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~yqsong/papers/2017-KDD-HINDROID.pdf)
  paper through section 3.1 (feature extraction). Create feature
  extraction code that extracts features from the Smali code into the
  graph described in the article. This will involve creating node and
  edge lists (the notation is borrowed from the paper):
    - The nodes will be APIs (and Apps, though to start, work with a
      single app).
    - The edges for graph B will be pairs of APIs that occur in the
      same code block (method).
    - The edges for graph P will be pairs of APIs that belong to the
      same package.
    - The edges for graph I will be pairs of APIs that are called
      with the same invocation in the app.

* For a single app, use the node and edge lists above to create
  NetworkX graphs for each graph above. Then:
    - Plot each graph separately.
    - Plot all of them in one graph (use the 'union' of two graphs
      in NetworkX). Color the edges from the different graphs
      differently.
    - What does the distribution of node degrees look like? Can you
      tell something from the app that way?
    - Compute the clustering coefficient of each node. Can you
      interpret what this means (as a feature)?
    - Which APIs, Packages, etc are most common in your app? What
      are the basic node statistics?

* Add the 'graph extraction' code to your data ingestion
  pipeline (in a py file!). That is, add code that takes Smali code to
  graphs. Next you will create graph-based EDA code for analyzing the
  apps.
  
* Try the classification task from last week: Select
  apps of two different types (e.g. games and productivity apps),
  calculate graph statistics/features and see if you can classify the
  app type using a classifier in scikit-learn. Try to brainstorm
  features with others and look at networkX methods for possible graph
  statistics to calculate.

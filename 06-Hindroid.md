# Building the Classifier

### Topics

* Implement the basic Hindroid Malware Classifier.
* Assess different choices of kernel.
* Think about sampling schemes.
  
## Analyses / Reading

* Read the Hindroid paper, sections 3.2, 4.1, 4.2, 4.5. Pay particular
  attention to the table of results evaluating the different
  metapaths. 

* Implement the Hindroid Malware classifier for various kernels on a
  dataset of your design. (Try kernels: `AA^T`, `ABA^T`, APA^T`,
  `APBP^TA^T`).

* Experiment with different sampling for your training data -- in
  particular, for which types of Malware is the algorithm more
  performant?

## Questions

* What properties do these different meta-paths capturing in the data?
* Why do all of the meta-paths in the Hindroid kernels start and end
  with the adjacency matrix A? (*)
* Which kernels do best at classfying which types of Malware?
* A dataset will be placed in `/datasets/dsc180awi20/Malware/test`
  with subdirectories `positive` and `negative`. Use this data to
  train a classifier with kernel `ABA^T` and compute the resulting
  accuracy. (*)

## Introduction

* Tags: Cyber-Security, Code Learning, Graph Encoding
* Data: Java Code, Python Code, Smali Code.
* Methods: Graphs Techniques in Machine Learning

This capstone focuses on both:
1. detecting patterns of behavior in computer code and
2. learning graph-based techiques in machine learning.

These two topics will be covered in parallel throughout the sequence.

### Malware Detection

The bulk of the first half of the project will focus the task of
"computer code understanding" on the specific problem of detection
whether given source code is Malware or a benign application. The bulk
of the result replication will focus on static code analysis using
machine learning on graphs, as developed in the
[HinDroid](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~yqsong/papers/2017-KDD-HINDROID.pdf)
Paper.

*Important Note:* The ability to identify and combat Malware
requires understanding how Malware works. Such knowledge is
divorced from how it gets used by the practitioner; you, as the
practitioner must be aware of ethical concerns with the usage of this
knowledge and behave accordingly. In particular, while working with
the material in this course, you must *never* engage in illegal
activity related to your coursework and you must adhere to the code of
academic integrity, as laid out in th syllabus.

The topic of ethics will be regularly approached in this domain. For
more reading on the ethics of teaching Malware, see this opinion
pience [On the Growing Harm of Not Teaching
Malware](http://www.csl.sri.com/users/neumann/cacm223.pdf) and a
related study on the [ethics of teaching
malware](https://www.ieee-security.org/TC/SPW2014/papers/5103a001.PDF).

## References

References are found both in the weekly readings, as well as in
[references](references.md). These will be update throughout the
quarter.

## Data

The data for this project consists of
[apk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_application_package) files
(Android Application Packages), which are then decompiled to [Smali
Code](https://limbenjamin.com/articles/analysing-smali-code.html).

While portions focused on learning graph techniques will also use
examples from other languages (for example, python and java source code).

### Possible Projects

Proposals for this domain can focus on:
1. improving the detection and understanding of Malware from source code,
2. more generally attempt to quantitatively understand computer code,
3. further explore machine learning on graphs (using any appropriate dataset).

## Introduction

* Tags: Cyber-Security, Code Learning, Graph Encoding
* Data: Java Code, Python Code, Smali Code.
* Methods: Graphs Techniques in Machine Learning

This capstone focuses on both:
1. detecting patterns of behavior in computer code and
2. learning graph-based techiques in machine learning.

These two topics will be covered in parallel throughout the sequence. 

The bulk of the result replication will focus on the [HinDroid](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~yqsong/papers/2017-KDD-HINDROID.pdf) Paper.

## Data

The data for this project consists of
[apk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_application_package) files
(Android Application Packages), which are then decompiled to [Smali
Code](https://limbenjamin.com/articles/analysing-smali-code.html).

While portions focused on learning graph techniques will also use
examples from other languages (for example, python and java source code).

### Possible Projects

Proposals for this domain can focus on:
1. improving the detection and understanding of Malware from source code,
2. more generally attempt to quantitatively understand computer code,
3. further explore machine learning on graphs (using any appropriate dataset).
